The application is running successfully at **http://localhost:5173/**.

I have executed the following steps:
1.  **Dependency Check**: Verified and installed dependencies using `npm install`.
2.  **Cache Cleanup**: Cleared the Vite cache (`node_modules/.vite`) to resolve permission issues.
3.  **Server Start**: Started the development server using `npm run dev`.
4.  **Verification**: Navigated to the application in the browser and confirmed it loaded the "Ing Marcon V1.0" interface.

You can now interact with the application in your browser.
